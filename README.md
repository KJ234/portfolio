# portfolio

## Description
This project required me to develop my own portfolio page for potential employers to view. About me, my projects, and contact information are the three primary aspects of my portfolio.I decided to use some javascript and custom CSS.

## Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* typed.js

## Criteria that I met to achieve this:

Have displayed contact information so that the user can contact me.

* Links to my Github, LinkedIn and a personalised website of my resume so that the user can see my credentials and other work.
* Display pieces of my work in "My Projects" section, which when clicked it takes you to that deployed application.
* Each application project has: a title, link to the deployed version, link to the GitHub repository and a screenshot of the deployed application.
* Clicking the links in the navigation bar causes the UI to scroll to the corresponding section.
